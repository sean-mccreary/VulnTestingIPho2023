Bug hunting for factory reset on Iphone w/out passcode

The purpose of this repo is to try to find a way of repurposing unclaimed (and not attempted to be claimed) Iphones from bar lost and founds so that 
they can be repurposed as counters for fire saftey compliance, donated for philanthropic endevours, or genreally re-used to reduce waste. 

All phones in this experiement came from lost and found. All phones were kept charged and turned on for 3 months while being monitored for "lost iphone" prompts and incoming calls. Phones that had these prompts appear were called and returned to their owners. The remaining phones were kept for an additional 3 months before being released for experimentation.
